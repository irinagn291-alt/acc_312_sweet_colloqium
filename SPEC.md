## 1. Non-negotiable constraints

1. **No CocoaPods.** Dependencies come from Swift Package Manager, a local
   in-repo package, a vendored source folder, or nothing at all — per section 3.
2. **No shared code with other portfolio apps.** Business rules are re-implemented
   here under this app's own type names.
3. **All code, identifiers, comments, UI copy and the README are in English.**
4. **No launch gate, no WebView shell, no remote configuration, no analytics.**
   Guideline 4.2 (Minimum Functionality): this is a native SwiftUI product, not
   a web browsing experience. WKWebView / SFSafariViewController as UI is a
   reject. Push notifications, Core Location, and sharing do not make a
   browser or a thin catalog into an App Store app.
5. **Guideline 5.1.1 (Privacy):** never direct the user to grant camera access.
   A pre-permission screen may exist; the proceed button is **Continue** or
   **Next**, never "Allow camera", "Enable camera", "Grant camera", or a bare
   Allow/Enable that triggers `requestAccess`. The system alert is the only Allow.
6. **No CI files.** No `bitrise.yml`, no `Scripts/`, no `metadata/` folder.
7. **Assets are AI-generated.** No stock photography. SF Symbols may support
   small affordances but must never be the primary iconography.
8. **The app must build clean** with
   `xcodegen generate && xcodebuild -scheme Stackfreed -destination 'generic/platform=iOS' build`.
9. **Nothing may echo another app in this batch** in naming, layout or visuals.
10. **This is not a calorie meal-slot tracker** unless family is `food_tracker`.
   Do not invent food logging to fill the brief.

## 2. Product core

The product is offline-first. No account, no sign-in, no ads, no in-app purchase,
no analytics SDK, no remote config. All user data stays on the device.

A habit builder taps today's ring to close it so the week still holds.

### 2.1 User flow

1. Tap today's ring to close it
2. Miss a scheduled day, then tap that silent day to spend the lost beat
3. Open Dashboard to read the week ratio and streak
4. Edit the habit and the scheduled weekdays
5. See an unused lost beat drop when the week turns

### 2.2 Essential behaviour

- One primary habit
- Ring row with tap-to-close
- One lost beat per week spent on a past empty day
- Mended miss still counts
- Local log, no social

### 3.0 Product concept

This is the product the contracts below are assigned to. Do not substitute another.

**Family** — habit_rings

**Core** — A habit builder taps today's ring to close it so the week still holds.

**Audience** — People who fail streak apps that punish one miss. They close today first and spend the week's rest on a day that already slipped, not by parking a token in advance.

**User flow**

1. Tap today's ring to close it
2. Miss a scheduled day, then tap that silent day to spend the lost beat
3. Open Dashboard to read the week ratio and streak
4. Edit the habit and the scheduled weekdays
5. See an unused lost beat drop when the week turns

**Essential features**

- One primary habit
- Ring row with tap-to-close
- One lost beat per week spent on a past empty day
- Mended miss still counts
- Local log, no social

**Twist** — Lost-beat mend. Home is the ring row and the day timeline. Tapping today's ring fills that day's segment, writes a BeatMark, and closes the day. A scheduled day that stayed empty can take this week's one LostBeat: tapping that silent pallet writes a LostMark and the miss still counts. Tapping a future pallet does nothing. A second LostBeat in the same week does nothing. Seed already fills a prior segment so the opening tap can close today. Home verb: close-the-ring. Dashboard lists BeatMarks plus LostMarks. This week does not color until it ends. Local only.

**Why this is not a repeat** — Falspark already owns habit_rings as a week wheel whose home verb is dragging a false-ring onto a day you plan to miss. This app keeps the same family invariant — one primary habit, one weekly rest that still counts, Rings / Dashboard / Settings as destinations — but the home verb is tap-to-close on a ring row plus day timeline. Grace is spent only on a day that has already slipped; a future pallet cannot take the lost beat. Guidestoop is a map with a three-day unlock gate. Isopleth and Washfolio paint a year canvas. Occupath issues occupation tokens. The leftover closed axes (SpriteKit timeline, Renault masthead high-contrast, claymation collage) are unused combinations, not Falspark's shape-driven wood wheel. Scanner and search_api stay unused leftover axes; there is no food catalog and no three-tab bar.

### 3.0a Craft from the shipped portfolio

Full craft is in KNOWLEDGE.md. Follow it. Do not copy type names or layouts.
- Home: Rings row + day timeline. Tap fills the next segment.
- Invariant: 1 grace skip per week still counts toward streak. Week-target: current week not penalized. Consistency = completed/scheduled. Color from consistency.
- Never: Not Streakling's map. Grace is the product.
- Taste DNA is section 7.6. Do not invent a second look.
- A TabView with exactly three tabs is the factory stamp — use two or four-to-five destinations, or a different chrome. `-ReviewScreen today|log|goals` are launch keys, not tabs.

### 3.1 Architecture contract

The Remontoire is a closed ADT with cases Open, Beaten, and Mended; the Arbor is a fold over Pallets, and a fourth case is a defect. Beat samples the open Pallet for today, writes a BeatMark, and folds Open to Beaten; an empty Arbor writes Hollow. Mend writes a LostMark when the tapped Pallet is an empty scheduled day and this week still holds a LostBeat; Mend on a future Pallet is refused, and a second Mend while the week already holds a LostMark is refused. One observable Remontoire store owns every fold; views call beatToday and mendPallet and never keep a parallel bool. Unit tests prove Beat on today's Open Pallet, Mend on a past empty scheduled Pallet while LostBeat remains, both refuses, Hollow when no habit is seated, and that a Mended miss still counts toward completed over scheduled.

Put a short comment block at the top of each principal type stating the role it
plays in this architecture. The README must justify the pattern for this product.

### 3.2 UI contract

SwiftUI owns the masthead, the ring row, Dashboard, Settings, and onboarding. SpriteKit is confined to the day timeline on Rings: one SpriteView of clay pallet nodes for the week, with taps calling beatToday and mendPallet. That timeline is the mechanic, not a records list. Gate travel with accessibilityReduceMotion so Reduce Motion fades the group at once and the SpriteKit scene does not travel. Dashboard and Settings are stock List and Form sheets. No TabView. No second SpriteKit surface. Empty Rings and onboarding are full pages with frame maxHeight infinity and a bottom full-width CTA. Chrome lives inside Button labels with contentShape, min 44pt. Primary close uses one ButtonStyle with default, pressed, disabled, and loading. Mend is not the live-verb accent. One haptic on a successful Beat or Mend, none on presenting a sheet. Colour is never the only Open versus Beaten versus Mended signal. The ui axis string is never a section title.

### 3.3 Naming contract

Convention: Remontoire lexicon.

Examples to follow: `Pallet`, `BeatMark`, `LostBeat`, `mendPallet(_:)`

### 3.4 Dependency contract

Stackfreed ships no remote packages and no vendored sources. project.yml has no packages key. Foundation, SwiftUI, and the system SpriteKit framework only. SpriteView is the one allowed SpriteKit import. The leftover scanner axis AVCaptureMetadataOutput and the leftover search_api cgi search pl stay dark: never import AVFoundation, never request camera, never hit a catalog. Do not bundle a typeface.

### 3.5 Navigation contract

Arbor-locked chrome. The ring row and day timeline never leave the root. Close and mend fuse on Rings. There is no TabView and no pushed detail. Dashboard and Settings arrive as sheets from the arbor chrome. Dismissing a sheet returns to Rings. One haptic on a successful Beat or Mend, none on presenting a sheet. After onboarding, read ProcessInfo.processInfo.arguments once: ReviewScreen today stays on Rings, log presents Dashboard, goals presents Settings. Contact URL https://stackfreed-week.pro/contact-us lives on Settings.

### 3.6 Screen composition contract

Ring-row fused timeline (Rings holds close and mend; Dashboard and Settings are sheets)

Physical screens: Onboarding (three pages, Continue full width at the bottom), Rings (full-screen fused ring row plus SpriteKit day timeline; ReviewScreen today), Dashboard (sheet of BeatMarks plus LostMarks, week ratio, streak; ReviewScreen log), Settings (sheet: edit the habit and scheduled weekdays, contact URL, re-run onboarding, resetAllData; ReviewScreen goals). Empty Rings is a full page: No habit yet. Close the first ring. Seed already fills a prior segment so the opening tap can close today. This week does not color until it ends. No tab bar. No Today, Scan, Search, or Goals screens.

Section 5 lists the logical functions that must exist. This section decides how
they are grouped into actual screens. Where the two disagree, this section wins.

A TabView with exactly three tabs is the factory stamp — use two or four-to-five destinations, or a different chrome. `-ReviewScreen today|log|goals` are launch keys, not tabs.

---

## 4. Target file organization

Scheme: **By remontoire role (Remontoire, Pallet, Arbor, BeatMark, LostMark, LostBeat)**

```
Stackfreed/
  Remontoire/ Pallet/ Arbor/ BeatMark/ LostMark/ LostBeat/
  Assets.xcassets/
```

Adapt the leaf files to the architecture, but the top-level shape is fixed. Do
not create a `Utils/` or `Helpers/` dumping ground.

---

## 5. Screens

Build the screens named in section 3.6. The labels below are logical;
actual type names follow this app's naming convention.

### 5.1 Onboarding
Three to four pages. Explains the product, writes initial settings, sets a
completion flag. Skip still writes sensible defaults. Re-runnable from Settings.

### 5.2 Rings
A first-class screen for **Rings**. Must render empty, populated and error states.

### 5.3 Dashboard
A first-class screen for **Dashboard**. Must render empty, populated and error states.

### 5.4 Settings
A first-class screen for **Settings**. Must render empty, populated and error states.

### 5.5 Settings
Holds: re-run onboarding, reset all data (confirmed), and the contact link to
the domain contact-us URL.

### 5.6 Twist screen
See section 12. The twist needs at least one screen of its own plus a surface on the home screen.


---

## 6. Domain model

Minimum entities, named per this app's convention:

- **Habit** — named per this app's convention.
- **HabitLog** — named per this app's convention.
- Plus whatever the twist in section 12 requires.


---

## 7. Design system

Direction: **renault · masthead · high-contrast**

### 7.1 Palette

| Token | Hex | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `background` | `#FCFCFC` | Screen background |
| `surface` | `#F5F5F5` | Cards, rows, sheets |
| `ink` | `#121212` | Primary text and icons |
| `accent` | `#2753B9` | Primary action, key figure, progress fill |
| `muted` | `#575757` | Secondary text, dividers, disabled |

Define these as named colours in `Assets.xcassets` and reach them through one
typed accessor. Never hard-code a hex string anywhere else.

### 7.2 Typography

Family: **SF Pro**

SF Pro Rounded via Font.system with design rounded is the only face. The assigned type move is soft rounded UI type, one playful moment, no serif, agency feel: huge short display on the masthead (the habit name or Close), one or two lines, never more than four, never above 34pt, then 17pt body. The one playful moment is the Close verb in extra-bold rounded; every other line stays Regular or Semibold. No serif, no New York, no bundled NouvelR. At most six named steps behind one accessor: display, title, headline, body, caption, micro. Hairline rules sit under the masthead. Week ratio, streak, and YYYYMMDD keys go through NumberFormatter with tabular figures. Dynamic Type; at AX5 the display may drop a step so it never clips. @ScaledMetric for the ring row. No Font.custom and no fixedSize. Never below 12pt. Day edges use Calendar.current.startOfDay then fold to Int YYYYMMDD.

Define a type scale of at most six steps behind one accessor and use only those
steps. Text stays legible at the largest Dynamic Type size.

### 7.3 Layout

- One base spacing unit (4 or 8 pt); only multiples of it.
- Corner radius and elevation are fixed by section 7.4, not chosen per screen.
- Every interactive element is at least 44x44 pt.

### 7.4 Component contract

Corner radius: **28pt** for cards, sheets and primary surfaces; **14pt** for chips, badges and small controls. Reach both through one accessor. Never a bare literal number, and never zero — a hard edge is not this app's design direction.

Elevation: **hairline+fill** — a 1pt hairline border plus a flat fill tint, reused everywhere a surface sits above another.

Primary control: **bordered prominent** — primary actions use `.buttonStyle(.borderedProminent)` or an equivalent filled, bordered shape.

This is arithmetic, not a suggestion: every card, sheet, chip and button in this app uses these two radii and this elevation style. Do not introduce a second radius or a second elevation style.

### 7.5 Custom rendering scope

This app's `ui` axis is **SwiftUI SpriteKit integration · timeline**.

If that approach uses anything beyond stock SwiftUI/UIKit controls — `Canvas`, `CALayer`, Metal, SceneKit, SpriteKit, RealityKit, a hand-drawn `UIViewRepresentable`, or any other pixel-level custom rendering — confine it to exactly one hero surface on one screen (the mechanic's home view, or the one screen this axis exists to showcase). Every other screen — every list, every settings screen, every sheet, every secondary surface — is built from stock components: `List`, `Form`, `NavigationStack`, `TabView`, `Button`, `.sheet`, native `Text`/`Image`. A second custom-rendered surface elsewhere in the app is a defect, not a stylistic choice.

If **SwiftUI SpriteKit integration · timeline** is already fully native (no custom drawing layer), this section is satisfied automatically — there is nothing to confine.

The `ui` axis value is an implementation choice. It must never appear as a user-visible section title or label.

### 7.6 Taste DNA

Aesthetic: **agency** (High-end agency: huge type, air, one accent, hairline depth.)

Reference system: **renault** — steal rhythm and restraint, not their colours or logos.

Mood: **French automotive. Vibrant aurora gradients, NouvelR typography, bold energy.**.

Home rhythm (`masthead`, comfortable): A masthead, a rule, a column. Newspaper, not cards.

High-end agency: huge type, air, one accent, hairline depth. Layout `masthead`, density comfortable. Kit 28/14, hairline+fill, bordered prominent. Palette recipe `high-contrast`. Grouped reveals step 40-60ms, cap 360ms total. Last item must not arrive late. Reduce Motion: the group appears at once. Reduce Motion: fade only. Do not invent a second radius or a second accent.

Type move: Soft rounded UI type, one playful moment, no serif. Reference type feel: agency.

Motion (`stagger`): Grouped reveals step 40-60ms, cap 360ms total. Last item must not arrive late. Reduce Motion: the group appears at once.

Voice (`warm`): Human and brief. Empty states invite. Errors stay calm and useful.

Anti-slop from KNOWLEDGE.md applies. Taste never overrides contrast, 44pt hits, VoiceOver labels, or Reduce Motion.

---

## 8. UI and UX quality bar

Every item here is a defect if it is missing. Do not treat this as advice.

**Layout**

- Respect safe areas on every screen. Nothing sits under the notch, the Dynamic
  Island or the home indicator.
- The app is portrait-only on iPhone. Lock it in the Info settings and do not
  write rotation-dependent layout.
- No layout shift when asynchronous data arrives. Reserve the final size up
  front, or use a redacted placeholder of the same dimensions.
- Long product names must truncate gracefully, never push a number off screen.
  Numbers win; names truncate.
- Sibling cards, images and titles never overlap. Each cell owns its frame;
  `scaledToFill` is clipped to that cell. A chopped headline or two canvases
  in one slot is a defect, not a collage.
- Minimum tap target 44x44 pt for every interactive element, including small
  icon buttons and list accessories.
- Pick one base spacing unit and use only multiples of it. No arbitrary values.

**Keyboard**

- The grams field uses `.decimalPad`, and the decimal separator matches the
  user's locale.
- Content scrolls out from under the keyboard. The focused field is always
  visible.
- Tapping outside the field, or scrolling, dismisses the keyboard.
- Validate on the fly: reject negative and non-numeric input rather than
  crashing the parser later.

**Loading and state**

- Every asynchronous operation has a visible loading state.
- Guard against the spinner flash: if the work finishes in under 150 ms, do not
  show a spinner at all.
- Every list has a designed empty state containing a primary action, not just a
  sentence of text.
- Every error state offers a retry, and states plainly what failed.
- Disable the primary button while its action is in flight so it cannot be
  double-tapped into a double push or a duplicate entry.

**Typography and accessibility**

- All text scales with Dynamic Type. Verify at the largest accessibility size:
  nothing may clip or overlap.
- Every icon-only control has an `accessibilityLabel`. Decorative images are
  marked as decorative so VoiceOver skips them.
- Colour is never the only signal. Pair it with a label, a shape or an icon.
- Honour Reduce Motion: replace movement-heavy transitions with a fade.
- Meet contrast requirements against the palette in section 7. Check the muted
  colour against the background specifically; that is where these palettes fail.

**Formatting**

- Format every number with `NumberFormatter`, never string interpolation. Group
  separators and decimal separators must follow the locale.
- Energy is shown as a whole number of kcal. Macros are shown with at most one
  decimal place.
- Round only at the point of display. Stored values keep full precision.
- Day boundaries use `Calendar.current.startOfDay(for:)` in the user's current
  time zone. Handle the day changing while the app is open, and handle the
  short and long days that daylight saving produces.
- Unknown macro values render as a dash or the word "unknown", never as 0.

**Motion and feedback**

- One haptic on a successful commit (a food logged, a target saved). No haptic
  on navigation.
- Animations are short (0.2 to 0.35 s) and use a single shared easing curve.
- Nothing animates on first appearance of a screen except an intentional entry
  transition.

**Navigation**

- Back always works and never loses entered data without asking.
- A destructive action (delete a log row, reset all data) is confirmed.
- Modal sheets can always be dismissed; there is no dead end.
- Deep state is restorable: relaunching returns the user to a sane screen.


Every item here is a defect if it is missing. Section 7.4 fixed the numbers —
this is where they have to show up on screen.

**Hierarchy and density**

- Every screen has exactly one dominant element (a hero number, a canvas, a
  primary card) that the eye lands on first. A screen where every element has
  equal weight reads as a spreadsheet, not a product.
- Related content is grouped into a card or a section with the elevation
  style from 7.4, not left floating on the bare background.
- Unused flat background is not "minimal" — see the density rule in
  `KNOWLEDGE.md`. If a screen has room left after the mechanic and the
  content, add a secondary surface (a stat strip, a recent-activity card, a
  related-item row), not a `Spacer`.

**Components**

- Every card, sheet, chip, row and button in the app uses the corner radius
  and elevation from section 7.4. No screen introduces its own radius or its
  own shadow value "just for this one card".
- Buttons have a pressed state (`ButtonStyle` with a scale or opacity change
  on `isPressed`) and a disabled state that is visibly different, not just
  non-interactive.
- Chips and badges are pill or rounded-rect shaped per 7.4, never a bare
  `Text` with no background sitting where a control is expected.
- A functional control (add, filter, sort, close, more, share, delete) is an
  SF Symbol inside a properly hit-targeted `Button`. SF Symbols are fine and
  expected here — section 16 only bans them as the app's primary brand
  iconography (app icon, empty-state hero, onboarding art), which is what the
  generated assets in section 13 are for.

**Depth and material**

- At least one surface in the app (a sheet, a modal, a floating toolbar) uses
  the elevation style from 7.4 to visibly sit above the content behind it.
  A flat app with no depth anywhere reads as a wireframe.
- Icons and generated art sit on the surface colour from 7.1, never directly
  on a colour that makes their edges disappear.

**Motion as feedback, not decoration**

- The one dominant element in a screen (7.4's primary control, the mechanic's
  hero) responds visibly to touch: a scale, a colour shift, a haptic — pick
  at least one. A control that looks identical pressed and unpressed reads as
  broken, not calm.

**Taste DNA (section 7.6)**

- Home uses the assigned layout family and density. Three identical equal-weight
  cards, a leftover bento hole, or a second column structure copied down the
  page is a defect.
- Copy follows the assigned voice. No em-dash, no elevate/unlock/seamless, no
  emoji, no SECTION 01 labels.
- Motion follows the assigned personality and honours Reduce Motion with a fade.
  One signature motion per view. No glow stacked on glass stacked on spring.
- Tokens by intent: the live verb wears accent; delete does not wear primary.


---

## 9. Concurrency

The target builds with Swift 6.2 and `SWIFT_STRICT_CONCURRENCY = complete`. It
must compile with **zero concurrency warnings**. Warnings here become crashes
later, so they are not negotiable.

- All UI types are `@MainActor`. Annotate the type, not individual methods.
- Any value crossing an actor boundary is `Sendable`. Prefer immutable structs
  of primitives.
- Do not use `@unchecked Sendable`. If it is genuinely unavoidable, it needs a
  comment explaining what guarantees the safety.
- No mutable global state. No `static var` that is written after launch.
- Networking and storage APIs are `async` and honour cancellation. When the
  search query changes, cancel the in-flight task; do not let a stale response
  overwrite fresh results.
- Use structured concurrency. Avoid `Task.detached` unless there is a stated
  reason. Never fire a `Task` that outlives the view without owning it.
- Never use `DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter` to paper over an ordering problem.
  Fix the ordering.
- `Timer` and notification observers are invalidated in `deinit` or on
  disappear.


---

## 10. Persistence engineering

Chosen technology: **UserDefaults+Codable**

One Codable RemontoireDocument (schemaVersion from 1, one primary habit, scheduled weekdays, Arbor of Pallets keyed as Int YYYYMMDD, BeatMarks, LostMarks, and this week's LostBeat) encoded to JSON Data in UserDefaults under skf.arbor.v1. Day keys are Int in YYYYMMDD form derived from Calendar.current.startOfDay; never Date as a dictionary key. In-memory Remontoire store is the source of truth; UserDefaults is the projection. Debounce writes; flush when scenePhase becomes inactive or background; encode after every Beat, Mend, habit edit, and weekday edit. Decoding failure falls back to Hollow with no writes, never a crash. resetAllData() is reachable from Settings. Simulator seed only once behind skf.demo.v1 writes a prior BeatMark so today's ring can close, seats one scheduled week with at least one past empty pallet that can take the LostBeat, fills Dashboard with several BeatMarks plus one LostMark on an ended week, leaves Beat enabled, marks onboarding complete, and never seeds a blocked Mend as the first frame. Never seed on a device. Views never touch UserDefaults.

This app persists to **files on disk**. The following are mandatory.

- Write atomically. Either `Data.write(to:options: .atomic)` or write to a
  temporary file and `FileManager.replaceItemAt`. A non-atomic write that is
  interrupted leaves a truncated file and the app will not launch.
- Create the containing directory with
  `withIntermediateDirectories: true` before the first write.
- Every document carries a `schemaVersion` field from version 1, and the decoder
  switches on it.
- Decoding failure must be recoverable: keep the previous good file as a
  `.backup`, fall back to it, and if that also fails start from empty state and
  tell the user. Never crash on a corrupt file.
- All file IO happens off the main thread. The main thread never blocks on disk.
- Debounce writes during rapid edits, but force a flush when `scenePhase`
  becomes `.inactive` or `.background`, and after any destructive action.
- Exclude caches from backup with `URLResourceValues.isExcludedFromBackup` where
  appropriate; user data belongs in Application Support and should be backed up.
- Keep an explicit in-memory source of truth and treat the file as a projection
  of it, so a failed write never leaves the UI showing data that does not exist.


Regardless of technology:

- One seam between domain logic and storage; the UI never touches storage types.
- Writes survive a force-quit. Do not rely on `applicationWillTerminate`.
- Provide `resetAllData()`, used by tests and reachable from Settings.

---

## 11. Networking

- One client type owns both Open Food Facts endpoints.
- Set `User-Agent` on every request. Open Food Facts throttles clients that do
  not identify themselves.
- 15 second timeout. One retry on a transient transport failure, then a typed
  error. Do not retry a 404.
- Cancel the in-flight search when the query changes. Debounce input by roughly
  300 ms.
- Decode into DTO types that mirror the JSON exactly, then map to domain types.
  Never decode straight into your domain model.
- Dedicated `JSONDecoder` with `.useDefaultKeys`. Never `convertFromSnakeCase` —
  Open Food Facts keys like `energy-kcal_100g` break snake_case conversion.
- Resolve a scanned code with `GET /api/v2/product/<barcode>.json`, not a search.
- Open Food Facts data is user-contributed and frequently incomplete. Every
  numeric field is optional. A product with no energy value is a normal case
  that the UI must present, not an error.
- Some numeric fields arrive as strings. The decoder must accept both a number
  and a numeric string for every nutriment.
- `status` of `0` in the product response means not found. Map it to a distinct
  error case so the UI can offer manual entry.
- Never crash on malformed JSON. A decoding failure is a handled error.
- Cache every resolved product locally on success, so the app degrades to a
  working offline catalogue.


Set `User-Agent: Stackfreed/1.0 (iOS; +https://stackfreed-week.pro)` on every request. Never reuse another app's string.
No required remote catalog. Network only if this product actually needs it.

---

## 11b. App Store readiness

The app must be submittable without further work.

- `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` in the target, declaring the UserDefaults access API
  reason `CA92.1` and the file timestamp reason `C617.1`, with
  `NSPrivacyTracking` false and no collected data types.
- `INFOPLIST_KEY_ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption = NO` in the pbxproj so TestFlight
  does not sit on Missing Compliance.
- `NSCameraUsageDescription` written specifically for this app. Generic strings
  get rejected.
- `LSApplicationCategoryType` of `public.app-category.healthcare-fitness`.
- Portrait only, iPhone and iPad (`TARGETED_DEVICE_FAMILY = "1,2"`).
- No account, no sign-in, no delete-account flow, no in-app purchase, no ads, no
  user-generated content, and therefore no report or block UI.
- App Tracking Transparency is never invoked.
- The camera is the only sensitive permission requested.
- Guideline 5.1.1 (Privacy): do not encourage or direct the user to grant camera
  access. A pre-permission screen may exist, but the proceed button must be
  **Continue** or **Next** — never "Allow camera", "Enable camera",
  "Grant camera", or a bare Allow/Enable that calls `requestAccess`. The
  system dialog is the only Allow. Denied/restricted offers Open Settings.
- The app must not present itself as a clinician or as medical advice.
- Guideline 4.2 (Design — Minimum Functionality): the binary must be a native
  product, not a web browsing experience. No WKWebView / SFSafariViewController
  / UIWebView as home, a tab, or the primary UX. A content catalog, article
  reader, or site wrapper that could be a website is a reject. Push
  notifications, Core Location, and sharing do not make that acceptable.
- Guideline 1.4.1 (Safety — Physical Harm): if the binary shows health or
  medical recommendations, body-based targets, dosages, "you should" guidance,
  or product health claims (food, drink, supplement, remedy), put citations
  in the app. Tappable links to the sources, easy to find: same screen as the
  claim, or a Sources row one tap from Settings. Name the source (Open Food
  Facts, USDA FoodData Central, WHO, NIH MedlinePlus, …) and link it. A
  "not medical advice" footer without sources is a reject. A personal log
  that never advises does not invent claims to cite.
- Nutrition catalog data is credited to the database this app actually uses
  (Open Food Facts unless the spec names another). Credit is a tappable link,
  not a dead "OpenFoodFacts" label.


Ignore the food-log and Open Food Facts lines above when they conflict with this

## 12. Functional twist: Lost-beat mend (tap an empty past day; future days refuse)

Lost-beat mend lives on Rings: tapping a silent past scheduled pallet writes a LostMark while this week still holds a LostBeat, and that miss still counts toward completed over scheduled. Tapping a future pallet is refused, and a second Mend while the week already holds a LostMark is refused. An unused LostBeat drops when the week turns. Home verb is close-the-ring: tapping today's ring writes a BeatMark and folds Open to Beaten. Grace is spent only on a day that already slipped, never parked on a future pallet. Unit-test the fold and the family invariant: one grace skip per week still counts, the current week is not penalized, consistency is completed over scheduled, and color comes from ended weeks only.

This is the app's marketed differentiator. It must be:

- visible on the home screen, not buried in settings;
- backed by real persisted data, not a cosmetic flourish;
- covered by at least one unit test;
- described in the README as the reason a user would pick this app.

## 13. AI-generated assets

Art style: **Claymation claymorphism 3D · collage**


Base prompt, reused and extended for every asset:

```
Claymation claymorphism collage. Thumb-pressed clay volumes with stop-motion fingerprints and visible join seams, cut-paper collage layers stacked in shallow relief, studio tabletop lighting, solid clay subject, not glass, not wire, not a hollow vitrine, no lettering.
```

All 12 images below are required. Generate each one, export
as PNG, and add it to `Assets.xcassets` as its own image set named exactly as
given. Every name carries the `skf_` prefix.

### 13.1 App icon rules (strict)

The icon is rejected by App Store Connect if any of these are wrong:

- Exactly **1024 x 1024 px**.
- **No alpha channel.**
- sRGB colour profile, 8 bits per channel, PNG.
- **No text and no words** in the artwork.
- **No rounded corners and no built-in mask.**
- The subject stays inside the middle 80%.

### 13.2 Full asset list

| # | Image set | Size (px) | Alpha | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `skf_AppIcon` | 1024x1024 | **NO** | App Store icon. NO alpha channel, NO transparency, NO text, NO rounded corners, NO drop shadow outside the canvas. |
| 2 | `skf_Splash` | 1290x2796 | fill | Launch background. The middle third must stay quiet so the wordmark reads on top. |
| 3 | `skf_Onboarding1` | 1024x1536 | **required cutout** | Onboarding page 1 illustration: what the app is for. |
| 4 | `skf_Onboarding2` | 1024x1536 | **required cutout** | Onboarding page 2 illustration: the main verb. |
| 5 | `skf_Onboarding3` | 1024x1536 | **required cutout** | Onboarding page 3 illustration: why they stay. |
| 6 | `skf_EmptyHome` | 1024x1024 | **required cutout** | Empty state: the home screen has nothing yet. Calm and inviting, never sad. |
| 7 | `skf_EmptyList` | 1024x1024 | **required cutout** | Empty state: a secondary list has no rows. |
| 8 | `skf_CardBackdrop` | 1200x800 | fill | Backdrop art for a primary card. Low contrast so text stays readable. |
| 9 | `skf_ControlFace` | 512x512 | **required cutout** | Custom control artwork used for the primary interactive element. |
| 10 | `skf_TwistHero` | 1024x1024 | **required cutout** | Hero art for the 'Lost-beat mend (tap an empty past day; future days refuse)' feature screen. |
| 11 | `skf_SuccessMark` | 512x512 | **required cutout** | Shown briefly when the primary action succeeds. |
| 12 | `skf_HeaderDecor` | 1200x600 | **required cutout** | Decorative header accent on the main screen. |

### 13.3 Asset rules

- Cut-outs (everything except AppIcon, Splash, CardBackdrop): isolated subject,
  real PNG alpha, all four corners transparent. No square plate.
- Assets must be semantically different from each other.
- Record the exact prompt used for every asset in the README.
- SF Symbols are permitted only for close, chevron, share and similar system
  affordances.

Scanner frames, reticles, and seamless tiles are drawn in SwiftUI via `Path` or `Shape`. GenerateImage is not used for those. Every other in-app graphic (except AppIcon, Splash, CardBackdrop) is a **cutout**: isolated SOLID opaque subject in the center, real PNG alpha, all four corners transparent. An opaque square plate inside a circle or pentagon is a fail. A hollow glass box or wire frame with a transparent center is a fail.

## 14. Demo data

Seed a small local demo dataset for this family's entities so Simulator
screenshots are not empty. The same seed must mark onboarding complete and
fill the primary surface — otherwise `-ReviewScreen` never fires. Never seed
on a physical device. Guard with `#if targetEnvironment(simulator)` and
`skf.demo.v1`.

Seed the happy path: the home primary verb is enabled. The blocked / gated /
error state is a unit-test fixture, not Simulator home. Home chrome names the
job and the next tap in words a stranger knows. Axis values (`ui`, `naming`,
`architecture`) never become user-visible titles. A card that looks tappable
is a `Button`. A readout does not use button chrome.

---

## 16. Anti-patterns

The following will fail review:

- `try!`, `as!`, or force-unwrapping anything derived from the network, the
  database or a file.
- `fatalError` anywhere reachable at runtime. It is acceptable only for a
  programmer error in an initialiser that cannot fail in practice, and needs a
  comment.
- Swallowing an error with an empty `catch`.
- `print` used as production logging.
- A hard-coded hex colour outside the single colour accessor.
- A hard-coded font name outside the single typography accessor.
- An SF Symbol used as the app's brand iconography — the app icon, the
  empty-state hero, or onboarding art. Those come from section 13. SF Symbols
  are the right choice for every functional control (add, filter, sort,
  close, share, delete) — leaving those as bare text instead of a symbol is
  also a defect.
- Storing a value that can be computed (day totals, remaining budget, macro
  percentages).
- Blocking the main thread on disk or network work.
- `UIScreen.main` for sizing. Use the geometry the layout system gives you.
- Index positions used as list identity. Identity is a stable identifier.
- A view that reaches into the persistence layer directly, bypassing the
  architecture's designated seam.
- Business logic inside a `View` body or a `UIViewController` method, when the
  assigned architecture places it elsewhere.
- Copying a source file from another app in this batch.
- A `TabView` with exactly three tabs. That is the factory stamp — two or
  four-to-five destinations, or a different chrome. ReviewScreen keys are
  not tabs.

## 17. Tests

Add a unit test target `StackfreedTests` covering at minimum:

1. The core domain invariant of this family (the thing that would be wrong if
   the calculator, decay, crate, or log lied).
2. Empty, populated and invalid input paths for the primary verb.
3. The section 12 twist logic.
4. One architecture-specific test proving the pattern holds.
5. A persistence round-trip: write, relaunch-equivalent reload, verify.
6. Parse `ProcessInfo.processInfo.arguments` once after onboarding. 
   `-ReviewScreen today|log|goals` switches the running app's live navigation. Extra cover slugs open those screens.
   Cover that parser with a unit test. Do not host a `View` in the test.

---

## 18. README.md

Write `README.md` at the app folder root covering:

1. What the app does and who it is for.
2. The architecture used and **why** it suits this product.
3. The unique feature added and how it works.
4. The AI art style and the exact prompt used for every asset.
5. How this app differs from others in the batch.
6. Build instructions.

- [ ] Architecture matches **Remontoire ADT fold (Open | Beaten | Mended); the arbor is a fold over Pallets; Beat writes a BeatMark on today's Pallet and folds Open to Beaten; Mend writes a LostMark when the tapped Pallet is an empty scheduled day and this week still holds a LostBeat; Mend on a future Pallet is refused; a second Mend while the week already holds a LostMark is refused; Beat samples the open Pallet for today; empty arbor writes Hollow** with no leakage across layers.
- [ ] UI approach matches **SwiftUI SpriteKit integration · timeline**.
- [ ] Custom rendering, if any, is confined to one hero surface (section 7.5).
- [ ] Navigation matches **Arbor-locked chrome (the ring row and day timeline never leave; Dashboard and Settings arrive as sheets; close and mend fuse on Rings)**.

## 20. Build commands

```bash
cd Stackfreed
xcodegen generate
xcodebuild -scheme Stackfreed -destination 'generic/platform=iOS' CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO CODE_SIGNING_REQUIRED=NO build
xcrun simctl list devices available
xcodebuild -scheme Stackfreed -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,id=<UDID>' test
```

Signing is off only on that command line. Do not put CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED, CODE_SIGNING_REQUIRED, CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY or DEVELOPMENT_TEAM in project.yml — CI signs the archive. Leave CODE_SIGN_STYLE: Automatic as the scaffold set it. The exact simulator does not matter — use any available UDID from the list.
